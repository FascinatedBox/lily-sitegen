@title: Docgen

Usage: `lily docgen.lily <source> [target dir]`

Docgen is a tool for generating documentation from a Lily input. By default,
docgen outputs documentation into a directory called `doc`. The 'target dir' is
optional, for those wanting to specify a different output directory.

The documentation for Lily's core (predefined) libraries is generated by a
slightly modified version of docgen, for those curious what the output looks
like.

Docgen is currently very limited. It uses the same base code as `bindgen`, and
is thus limited to foreign Lily libraries. A future docgen that supports both
native and foreign code is planned.

Docgen is in the `FascinatedBox/lily-parsekit` repo at Github.
